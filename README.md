## How to build Microwatt and run Linux

[Microwatt](https://github.com/antonblanchard/microwatt) is an
easy-to-understand OpenPOWER ISA processor softcore.
Microwatt support has been in the upstream Linux kernel since 5.14.

Shenki's [linux-on-microwatt](https://github.com/shenki/linux-on-microwatt)
already provides an excellent HOWTO for building Microwatt and running
Linux on it; so why yet another repo of gists?

The answer is, LiteX.  If you want to run this on some FPGA board less
common than the Arty-A7 (for which Shenki's instructions are written),
or port to a new board, or change something related to the uncore
(DRAM controller, Ethernet MAC, etc),
chances are you will need to generate your own LiteX IP cores.
And it turns out you can't just take anywhich SHA of LiteX and LiteDRAM
and so on, and just hope it will work with Microwatt; you will find yourself
in a revision-dependency hell trying to match a working combination of SHAs.

This repo started as a manually-collected list of SHA signatures of the
different dependencies for Microwatt. This evolved into the `freeze-litex.sh`
script.
*It works on my machine*&#8482;,
but is mainly there for human reading.

### Generating IP cores and building Î¼W

1. From within `microwatt-gists`, clone microwatt
(and checkout whatever branch you are interested in).

2. Get yourself an initial Python environment to install
Migen, LiteX and FuseSoc into.
While I am writing this (November 2023) I use Python 3.11.6 and I just
`rm -rf  ~/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/*`;
I find the various upstream setup scripts we are going to run, are fighting
against `virtualenv` so it's causing more trouble than it is supposed to solve.

3. In `LX`, run `./freeze-litex.sh`.

4. (Re)generate the LiteX IP cores (in-place within `microwatt`).

5. Back in `microwatt-gists`, run `./LX/install-fusesoc.sh`.

6. Build Microwatt: `./LX/build-bitstream.sh`.
At the end it will ask if you want to flash it to the SPI flash
for indirect programming.  You may want to use that, or some other method
for FPGA configuration (e.g. to just quickly try if the bitstream works,
directly configuring Microwatt over JTAG is much faster).

7. ...the story about U-boot, Linux etc goes in here...
